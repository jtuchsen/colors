//! Colors
//! ======
//!
//!   Colors is a library that helps you color and style your text. It's a port of the colors
//!   library from [NodeJS/NPM][NPM colors], mostly undertaken as a learning exercise :).
//!
//! Examples
//! --------
//!     
//!     use colors::Style; // Import this to add colors to your string types
//!
//!     println!("{}", "I'm now magically printed in green!".green());
//!
//!   If you prefer to not have the traits added to your &str and strings then just call style
//!   directly, like so:
//!
//!     use colors::{Styles,style};
//!
//!     println!("{}", style(Styles::Blue, "I'm now blue!"))
//! 
//!   Although with the former style you get a nifty chaining syntax:
//!
//!     use colors::Style;
//!     println!("{}", "Bolded, underlined, and red!".bold().underline().red());
//!   
//! Issues
//! ------
//!
//! - You may have noticed a problem in the examples, we lose the native string substitution that
//!   Rusts "println!" macro comes with. This is pretty unfortunate and it looks like it's
//!   unavoidable. According to the [documentation][format], the compiler requires that the passed
//!   value be a string literal in order to enforce validity checking. If you know of a work around
//!   please submit a pull request.
//!
//! - This whole technique is also pretty un-rusty. Dynamically allocating a bunch Strings in order
//!   to wrap them in fancy Unicode characters isn't going to be very efficient. As an alternative
//!   you can use the nifty [TerminfoTerminal][] from Rusts standard library.
//!
//! Missing from Port / Todo
//! ------------------------
//! 
//! - Extra (silly) styles
//! - Color themes
//! - String substitution, for reasons given above
